# rails-stripe-rspec-tests
### Testing framework including (eventually) all Stripe processes tested
##### for user interaction for subscription memberships, products sales, webhoooks, etc.

This respository of Tests Only is being built specifically for testing our live in production app.
These tests are designed to test the Ruby 2.2.2 on Rails 4.2.1 rails-stripe-memberships-saas using only Stripe codes, Stripe tests, Stripe webhooks.

The original 3.2 branch of the membership app by [Daniel Kehoe](https://github.com/RailsApps) can be found there. We have developed this old and pure Stripe application to current codes, and now we share the tests.
